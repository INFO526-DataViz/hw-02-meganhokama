#Interpretation: In this ridgeplot, we are able to see the Airbnb review scores in Edinburgh Neighborhood. The vertical position of the ridges on the y-axis indicates the ordering of neighborhoods by their median review scores. Neighborhoods at the top have higher median review scores, while those at the bottom have lower median review scores.The width and shape of each ridge represent the density of review scores in that neighborhood. Wider ridges indicate higher density of review scores in a particular range, while narrower ridges indicate lower density.
